                  the Roll Call is normally used to check who is attending, and how many people are attending.
                  Through this, the Chairs can calculate the majority which is required within procedural and substantial voting. 
                  When you hear your Country's name, you can simply reply with “Present.” 
                  If you want to spice things up and declare how serious you are about the topic that is being discussed, you can also say “Present and Voting”.
